# Music_Organizer
Basic Program to compare music txt files with each other.
Program expects 4 input parameters:

      - txt file with the song names
      - txt file with the song artists in respect to the first file
      
      The other 2 files are the ones you are comparing to. (i.e if the songs from the 
      first 2 files are present in the second 2 files)
      
      - txt file with the song names
      - txt file with the song artists in respect to the first file
